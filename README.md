# PRODIGY_SD_03/Contact Management System

The aim of the program is to develop a program that allows users to store and manage contact information. The program will provide options to add a new contact by entering their name, phone number, and email address. It should also allow users to view their contact list, edit existing contacts, and delete contacts if needed.
